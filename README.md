# Robot-Arm-Placing
This project provides two algorithms to insert FPCB in tray with Robot arm.


# Environment
##### Robot arm : HCR-3
##### Camera : Realsense2
##### GPU : GTX 1060 3g


# INDEX
### Optical Flow
### Polar coordinate
### Optical Flow + Polar coordinate


# Optical Flow

First algorithm is based on Optical Flow using [FlowNet2.0](https://github.com/lmb-freiburg/flownet2-docker)

There are three pre-processing steps and six processing steps.
